Title: List_of_National_Basketball_Association_single-game_scoring_leaders
This is a complete listing of National Basketball Association players who have scored 60 or more points in a regular season game.
This feat has been accomplished 82 times in NBA history. Thirty-four players have scored 60 or more points in a game, while just eight players have joined the 70-point club. Only six players have scored 60 or more points on more than one occasion: Wilt Chamberlain (32 times), Kobe Bryant (6 times), Damian Lillard (5 times), Michael Jordan (4 times), James Harden (4 times), and Elgin Baylor (3 times). Chamberlain holds the single-game scoring record, having scored 100 points in a game in 1962. The youngest player to score at least 60 points in a regular season game is Devin Booker (70 points; 20 years and 145 days), and the oldest is Bryant (60 points; 37 years and 234 days).
