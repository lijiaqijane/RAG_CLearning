Title: The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show
The Ellen DeGeneres Show (stylized as ellen; often shortened to Ellen or The Ellen Show) is an American daytime television variety comedy talk show created and hosted by its namesake Ellen DeGeneres that aired for 19 seasons from September 8, 2003, to May 26, 2022, in syndication and was produced by Telepictures. The majority of stations owned by NBC Owned Television Stations, along with Hearst Television and Tegna, served as the program's largest affiliate base. For its first five seasons, the show was taped in Studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. From season 6 onwards, the show moved to being taped at Stage 1 on the nearby Warner Bros. lot. Since the beginning of the sixth season, The Ellen DeGeneres Show has been broadcast in high definition.
The show received 171 Daytime Emmy Award nominations and won 61 Daytime Emmy Awards as of 2021, including four for Outstanding Talk Show and seven for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment, making 11 total awards and surpassing the record held by The Oprah Winfrey Show, which won nine as Outstanding Talk Show before it was divided into two categories (Informative and Entertainment) in 2008. The show also won 17 People's Choice Awards. On May 21, 2019, DeGeneres announced she had signed for three more years, renewing the show through 2022. The eighteenth season premiered on September 21, 2020. On May 12, 2021, DeGeneres announced that the nineteenth season would be her last, which premiered on September 13, 2021.The final episode aired on May 26, 2022, as previously announced on March 17, 2022. New episodes with guest hosts, clip shows hosted by DeGeneres and more, and repeats aired on stations across the United States until September 9, after which most stations (including NBC O&O) began occupying the show's time slot with new newscasts or syndication programs such as The Kelly Clarkson Show.

Concept
The program combines comedy, celebrity, musical guests, and human-interest stories. The program often features audience participation games where prizes are awarded. During her Twelve Days of Giveaways promotion, audience members receive roughly $3,000 worth of prizes on each of twelve episodes. Because the show has become so popular, not all who arrive hoping to see a taping can fit into the studio, so an offshoot space, dubbed by Tom Hanks "The Riff Raff Room", was created. People seated here are often referenced and shown briefly on camera but watch the taping from off-stage. Other non-celebrities have been featured in an attempt by DeGeneres to give them 15 minutes of fame. Guests in this role have included intelligent children and small business owners. In the show's third season, DeGeneres began surprising fans by introducing them to their favorite celebrities.

Recurring elements
Several recurring sounds, gags, and catchphrases are used by DeGeneres depending on the topic of discussion or theme for a specific episode. For example, after DeGeneres says the phrase, "Aww Snap!", a sound effect of a whip cracking often is played. In her monologue, DeGeneres frequently thanks the audience's applause by saying "I feel the same way about you!" Other video segments include DeGeneres scaring people, playing pranks, taking part in faux-breaking news segments and interacting with crew members. Other recurring segments include those where DeGeneres comments on Internet videos, tabloid-style photographs of celebrities, advertisements on Craigslist, or voicemails left for her on an answering machine. Some segments feature audience members more prominently, including having audience members show hidden talents, pictures of others that resemble DeGeneres, and interviewing children.
DeGeneres frequently plays games with audience members and awards prizes based upon their performance. Games have included Pictionary-style drawing games, finding hidden objects within the studio, category, current event or pop-culture-based trivia, and various other stunt and charade-based games. DeGeneres also joked several times on the show about when a sequel to Finding Nemo, in which she famously had a lead role, would eventually release, as well as make references to the film. Eventually, the sequel, Finding Dory, was officially announced by DeGeneres.

"Celebrity Pranks!" is a segment in which DeGeneres often pulls a prank or scares celebrity guests, although she once pranked a pair of best friends she brought on the show (one posted a video of scaring the other every day for a year). Although any celebrity can fall victim to it at any time, some have fallen for it often including Taylor Swift, Eric Stonestreet, Sarah Paulson, and Selena Gomez, who have each fallen for it at least five times over multiple appearances. On several occasions, the celebrity is pranked more than once during the same show (Octavia Spencer and Sam Smith as well as the previously mentioned ones). Some pranks include (but are not limited to) scaring guests in the dressing room (usually the bathroom), having a staff member or another celebrity scare them onstage during the interview (using various methods ranging from simple to inventive), or backstage shenanigans where her own staff, particularly Andy Lassner, are frequent victims as well. On occasion the prank fails to scare the intended target, usually prompting a wisecrack from DeGeneres (e.g. Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, Daniel Radcliffe, and Garth Brooks). DeGeneres herself is an occasional target but has proven to be very difficult to pull a prank on with two celebrities (Steve Carell and Matt Lauer) being the only ones to successfully prank her as of April 2021.
"Chat Time With Ellen!" is a talk-show segment in which DeGeneres talks about—or to—people who have made viral videos.

In later years, Amy was joined in the haunted houses by her own mother, as well as the show's executive producer Andy Lassner. After Andy's stint going through with Amy, DeGeneres has made him go through every year, replacing Amy after she left the show. He's been joined by other DeGeneres staff members as well as celebrities like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Eric Stonestreet, Sarah Paulson, and DeGeneres's wife Portia de Rossi (as well as others) have also been sent to a haunted house. In one instance, DeGeneres herself joined Andy and went through a haunted house based on the 2017 film It. On other occasions some of DeGeneres' staff (Integrations Assistant Mackenzie, producer Matt Wright and Kalen Allen) went through without Andy. DeGeneres has occasionally sent celebrities on their own as well (Katie Lowes and Guillermo Diaz for example).
Average Andy is a segment in which DeGeneres sends her executive producer Andy Lassner to learn new skills from the world's most talented people.

The Masked Dancer is a segment spoofing the series The Masked Singer (to which DeGeneres notes that Fox had not sued her yet), where DeGeneres and tWitch attempt to guess the identity of a mystery guest concealed with a costume mask. Actual Masked Singer panelist Ken Jeong made an appearance as a guest judge on one episode. In January 2020, it was announced that Fox and Warner Bros. would produce The Masked Dancer as an actual spin-off of The Masked Singer, with DeGeneres as executive producer.
Burning Questions is a game where a celebrity guest sits in a chair in front of a buzzer while DeGeneres asks them a slew of personal (sometimes embarrassing) questions. The celebrity hits the buzzer when they answer the question.Heads Up!

Heads Up! is a game that DeGeneres plays with other celebrities. Originally, the game had players guess words or phrases on physical cards held to their foreheads by watching the other players act it out or give hints as time counted down. Later, DeGeneres and Warner Bros. Entertainment developed an app version of the game. The app became a huge success after its May 2013 launch, rising to the top of the App Store with over 650,000 downloads during its first month. By July 2016, it had been downloaded more than 25 million times and remained one of Apple's top-paid apps.

Dancing
Since the show's debut, DeGeneres has segued from her opening monologue by doing a dance. The dancing proved to be extremely popular with viewers, and has since progressed to a segment where DeGeneres dances into the audience, sometimes borrowing a coat or purse from someone's chair, and taking it with her. She has also featured a segment in which people teach her new dance moves.
One of her most famous dance moves is dancing over the table, where she straddles the coffee table and dances from one end to the other. Although she does not do it every day, dancing over the table is a recurring theme. As an April Fools' Day prank in 2009, the show's staff placed a wider table top over her normal table. During the show, when DeGeneres attempted to dance over it, she barely made it across, being forced on her tip-toes and using the table as leverage. On the seventh-season premiere, DeGeneres performed a dance segment with the cast of So You Think You Can Dance.
In September 2009, four major record labels sued the producers of the show for unspecified damages over the dance routine, for allegedly using songs without permission.In 2018, The New York Times profiled DeGeneres as she faced decisions of renewing her talkshow contract, and exploring other outlets for her creativity including her Netflix comedy special Relatable (2018), which spoofs her kind image. They noted that she felt boxed in with a reputation of always being nice, and the host who danced all time. DeGeneres—who acknowledges she has always been over-sensitive—fretted how her audience would react when she no longer wanted to dance. Her Christian Scientist upbringing included her father's psyche, “He was a very fearful man, he couldn't hear or engage with anything unpleasant.”

Sophia Grace and Rosie
Sophia Grace Brownlee (born April 18, 2003) and her cousin Rosie McClelland (born September 7, 2006) were first invited to the show after DeGeneres saw their YouTube video cover of "Super Bass" by Nicki Minaj, which Sophia Grace and Rosie posted on YouTube on September 19, 2011. The then eight- and five-year-old Essex, England natives became recurring cast members on the show, where they hosted their own segment called "Tea Time with Sophia Grace and Rosie". In the segment, the duo invites and interviews guest celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Hugh Grant, Julie Bowen, Harry Connick Jr., LL Cool J, Justin Bieber, and Reese Witherspoon over to tea. Sophia Grace and Rosie won the "Choice Webstar" at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards for this segment. They have also been correspondents during the red carpet events such as the Grammy Awards, the American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and the MTV Video Music Awards. They appeared in the third episode (June 2013) and the eleventh episode (September 2013) of Sam & Cat. According to her representative, Sophia Grace had been cast as Little Red Riding Hood in Walt Disney Pictures' film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods, but she withdrew before production. Sophia Grace and Rosie starred in their own movie called Sophia Grace and Rosie's Royal Adventure.

Production information
Taping location
From 2003 to early 2008, the program was originally taped in Studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. It was then filmed in Studio 1 (named "The Ellen Stage" since her 2,000th show, which took place in November 2015) on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank.

Personnel
The executive producers were DeGeneres, Mary Connelly, Ed Glavin, Andy Lassner, and (until his death in 2012) Jim Paratore. The writing staff has included Karen Kilgariff (former head writer), Karen Anderson, Margaret Smith, and DeGeneres. Margaret Smith left the show to work on her own projects, including her first book, What Was I Thinking? How Being a Stand Up Did Nothing to Prepare Me to Become a Single Mother (Crossroad Publishing, 2008). Amy Rhodes, a former writer for the program, regularly appeared on camera during various segments.

DJ
Unlike most talk shows, the show used a disc jockey to supply music rather than a band. Originally, the role was filled by Los Angeles-based DJ Scott K, who lasted only a few weeks. He was later replaced by Tony Okungbowa, who DJed through season 3. Due to his growing acting career, Okungbowa left the show, and a few guest DJs were brought in to try out for the position. Tony was replaced by actor/DJ Jon Abrahams for the fourth-season premiere. Abrahams stayed on the show for one season, and also left as his acting career grew. Ted Stryker of KROQ, was the DJ for the fifth season. Stryker stayed for one season until Okungbowa returned. In a 2012 episode, DJ Pauly D from Jersey Shore deejayed when Okungbowa was promoting his CD.
Starting in season 11, several episodes include celebrity "guest DJs" filling the DJ position in Okungbowa's absence. Stephen "tWitch" Boss of So You Think You Can Dance fame had been Ellen's permanent DJ for several years. After the series completed in 2022, Stephen "tWitch" Boss died on December 13, 2022.
Okungbowa made a return appearance on the show in the April 28, 2014, episode, while Loni made a return in the June 5, 2015, episode.

2007 Writers Guild strike
DeGeneres, a member of the Writers Guild of America, supported the 2007 writers' strike. However, on November 9, 2007, DeGeneres crossed the picket line to tape more episodes of her TV show stating: It was explained to me that no other daytime shows have shut down. I've got 135 employees that rely on me for a paycheck. But it's been the hardest thing in the world driving onto this lot.
DeGeneres decided to abstain from doing a monologue on her show (which is typically written by WGA writers) during the strike. Her show continued production as normal with the exception of her monologue being omitted. The WGAE issued a statement condemning DeGeneres, stating she was "not welcome in NY." DeGeneres's representatives asserted that she did not violate the WGA's agreement, arguing that she is competing with other first-run syndicated shows like Dr. Phil and Live with Regis and Kelly during the competitive November sweeps period, and that DeGeneres must fulfill her duties as host and producer, lest her show lose its time slot or be held in breach of contract. In addition, a statement defending DeGeneres was subsequently issued by AFTRA, pointing out that DeGeneres also works under the AFTRA TV Code, which bars her from striking. The WGAE then issued a response pointing out that DeGeneres is also a Writers Guild member, and that any writing work she did on her show during the strike constituted struck work.

COVID-19 pandemic
On March 11, 2020, DeGeneres announced via Twitter that for now she would be shooting her show without a studio audience to protect the health and safety of the fans, staff, and crew. In a tweet dated March 13, 2020, DeGeneres announced that production of the show had been suspended until March 30, 2020, to protect the health of her audience and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting on April 6, 2020, the show was produced from her own home.On April 16, 2020, Variety reported that crew members had accused the show of not communicating about their pay during the pandemic-induced shutdown.For the 18th-season premiere, DeGeneres returned to the studio with a virtual audience, and a 6-foot table between DeGeneres and her guests.
For the 19th-season premiere, the live audience returned wearing masks. By the end of the final season, masks were optional.

Controversy over work culture
In 2018, The New York Times profiled DeGeneres as she faced decisions of renewing her talk show contract, and exploring other outlets for her creativity including her Netflix comedy special Relatable (2018), which spoofed her public image. When asked about anonymous tabloid reports that she is not always nice to her workers, she said the accusations were false, saying "The one thing I want is for everyone to be happy and proud of where they work, and if not, don't work here."In July 2020, BuzzFeed News ran articles in which anonymous former employees accused the show of being a toxic workplace, accused the executive producers of harassment, as well as alleging an atmosphere with racist comments and microaggressions. WarnerMedia began an investigation. DeGeneres apologized to her staff, writing that "she intended for her show to be a place where 'no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect' and that she was 'disappointed to learn that this has not been the case.'" Following the investigation, three executives were fired, executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman, and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman. The show vowed to take steps to change the culture; DeGeneres apologized again during the eighteenth season's September 2020 opening. Her DJ, Stephen "tWitch" Boss, was promoted to co-executive producer and has served as host of the show filling in for her.

Ending
On May 12, 2021, shortly after the controversy, DeGeneres confirmed that the show would conclude at the end of the 2021–22 season, the show's nineteenth, coinciding with the end of her then-current contract. Warner Bros. was not initially expected to offer a direct replacement program, and lead carrier NBC Owned Television Stations announced it would move The Kelly Clarkson Show, which is produced by sister company NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, into the Ellen timeslot on its stations. Other stations will make individual decisions about replacement programming, which may include additional local newscasts; a few stations indicated interest in the possibility of a show hosted by frequent Ellen fill-in host Tiffany Haddish, but no such program was ever announced.On March 17, 2022, Warner Bros. announced that the final original episode hosted by DeGeneres would air on May 26; the final episode was recorded on April 28. The studio added that new episodes with guest hosts would air, alongside repeats and compilations, through September 9.In November 2021, Deadline reported that Warner Bros. was in discussions with local station groups about a potential new daytime talk show hosted by Jennifer Hudson that could debut as soon as fall 2022, which the studio foresees as a "successor" to Ellen, notwithstanding the prior announcement by the NBC-owned stations. WB subsequently announced The Jennifer Hudson Show would debut in fall 2022, with Fox Television Stations and Hearst Television as its lead carriers.The show's final episode, which featured appearances by Jennifer Aniston, Billie Eilish and Pink, aired as scheduled on May 26, 2022.

Episodes
During the course of the series, 3,294 episodes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show aired over nineteen seasons, between September 8, 2003, and May 26, 2022.

Special episodes
Several episodes have aired with a special theme or format, including a "Backwards Show", entire episodes themed around Broadway productions, a Thanksgiving special taped in the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, an entire episode which included Deltalina filmed on a Delta airplane, her 12 Days of Giveaways shows and Ellen's Birthday Show. Other recurring themes feature products from sponsors DeGeneres likes (similar to Oprah's Favorite Things from the now ended The Oprah Winfrey Show), specials following awards show telecasts (such as the Academy Awards), and numerous milestone episodes (e.g., DeGeneres's 1,000th, 1,300th, 1,500th, etc. broadcasts). In 2017, an episode aired commemorating the 20th anniversary of "The Puppy Episode," the episode of her sitcom Ellen, in which her character Ellen Morgan came out as a lesbian.
The episode titled "Sirdeaner Walker Interview" was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for "Outstanding Talk Show Episode" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.On January 11, 2013, DeGeneres announced that she was going to Australia in March with her wife, Australian actress Portia de Rossi, after having wanted to go for many years, being unable to visit in summer (which she preferred) due to taping conflicts of her show. Toward the end of the episode, which featured Nicole Kidman as a guest, she announced to the audience that they will also be going on a holiday to Australia in a giveaway special.
On March 3, 2014, DeGeneres hosted the show live, one day after her being the host of the 86th Academy Awards. This episode features that year's Oscar winners Cate Blanchett, Jared Leto, and Lupita Nyong'o as guests.
