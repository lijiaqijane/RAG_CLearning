The series employs a panel of four coaches who critique the artists' performances and guide their teams of selected artists through the remainder of the season. They also compete to ensure that their act wins the competition, thus making them the winning coach. The original panel featured Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green, Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton; the panel for the current twenty-fourth season features Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Niall Horan, and Reba McEntire. Other coaches from previous seasons include Shakira, Usher, Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson, Nick Jonas, Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello and Chance the Rapper. In the fifteenth season, Kelsea Ballerini was featured as an off-screen fifth coach for "Comeback Stage" contestants. Bebe Rexha took over as the "Comeback Stage" coach for the sixteenth season.

Concept
An adaptation of the Dutch show The Voice of Holland, NBC announced the show under the name The Voice of America in December 2010; its name was soon shortened to The Voice due the association of the former name with a popular US news and radio broadcaster. Notably, the American edition of the series is the only one in the franchise that does not feature its country's name. In each season, the winner receives $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Republic Records (seasons 1 and 2) or later Universal Music Group (season 3–present).

Selection process and format
Each season begins with the "Blind Auditions", where coaches form their team of artists whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The number of artists varies per season, with a set range between 8 and 16 artists. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read "I want you." At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects their coach if more than one coach expresses interest. Introduced in the 14th season is "Block", which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant.
In the "Battle Rounds", each coach pairs two of their team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance in the competition. Each coach are assisted by different celebrity advisors varies each season. In season one, coaches sit alongside their respective advisors in the battle stage; however, the advisors no longer join the coaches in the battle stage starting season two. In season 23, there are no advisors and its coach assumed the duties for advising the artists alone. Season three introduced "steals", allowing each coach to save/select individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach. First seen in the eighth season, artists are either given a walkover or is reassigned to a three-way battle in the event of another artist withdrawing from the competition if each coach sees fit. Saves were also added starting Season 14, which lets a coach prevent someone that they eliminated on their team from going home; in Season 23, Saves are replaced with "Playoff Pass" (based on the Battle Pass from the Australian version) which allow one artist to exempt them from participating in the Knockouts and directly advance to the Playoffs (the other artist advancing to the Knockouts as usual).
The Knockout Rounds were also introduced in season three (except for seasons six and sixteen). A pair of artists within a team are selected to sing individual performances in succession. They are not told until a few minutes prior to their performances who their partner is. The artists get to choose their own songs in this round, although they continue to get help and advice from their respective coaches, and since season six, a celebrity advisor serving as a mega mentor (except seasons 14 and 22). At the conclusion of the performances, coaches would decide which one of each pair gets to advance to the next round. Similar to the battle rounds, the coaches can steal one eliminated artist from another coach starting with season five. Starting in season 14, coaches can save one eliminated artist from their own team. From season 18 till 20, artists who were saved faced a Four-Way Knockout, with the winner decided through a public vote.The "Battles, Round 2" were introduced to replace the Knockout Rounds in season six. Similar to the Knockout Rounds, each singer is paired within their team. One celebrity key adviser also assists all four of the coaches and their teams in preparation of these rounds. Coaches give each Battle pairing a list of songs and each pair must agree on which song to sing. Like the first Battle round, each coach can still decide which of their singers in each pair will advance to the next round, and also allowed one steal.In the sixteenth season, the knockouts were replaced by The Live Cross Battles, a format identical to the Cross Battles from the Chinese version of The Voice. Each coach selects an artist to perform with another coach's artist together. The artist that receives the public vote will move on to the Playoffs, while the losing artist may be eliminated from the competition. The Live Cross Battles did not return in season seventeen due to poor reception.Previously eliminated artists can also advance to compete in the live shows; between seasons nine and thirteen (except season 11), each coach saved one artist (from either the Battle or Knockout rounds) to put through to the Live Playoffs. For seasons 15, 16 and 20, selected singers (prior to the Live elimination rounds) are put through to the "Comeback Stage" (which would be mentored by a fifth coach) and competed in a series of duels for a place in the live shows, with the winner earning a right to join a team of their choice. Season 21 added "Voice Comeback" where each coach picked one artist to compete in a Twitter poll, and only one artist with the most votes moves on.
In the final live performance phase of the competition (playoffs and elimination rounds), artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner.Under the current format since season three in favor on a more competitive standard previously seen on other similar reality shows, any artists, regardless of each team, who earned the lowest number of votes were progressively eliminated each week until five artists remain (three until season 6, then four prior to season 17), hence introducing a possibility where at least one coach would not represent a single artist in the finale.
Prior to season three, the coaches have the power to save one artist that had not received the public's vote that week, and as of season two, "last chance performance" are added where artists performed an additional song to vie for their coach's save, or other twists employed such as "instant elimination", where an artist faced immediate elimination without going through a public vote. However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote. Season 18-20 temporarily reverted this format allowing each coach to guarantee at least one artist advancing in the finale to accommodate the short number of live shows at three weeks, but these changes were reversed on Season 21 by reverting to the regular elimination format while retaining the top five finalists.

Voting system
In a first for a music competition series, NBC and Universal Republic Records offered fans of the show the ability to vote for their favorite artists by purchasing the studio versions of the songs that they perform on the live show each week via the iTunes Store. Alternative methods of voting can be done through toll-free phone calls (until season 8), text messaging, "The Voice Official App on NBC" app, and online votes via NBC.com and Facebook. Each method is limited to ten votes per user, and voting lasts until noon EST the next day.
From the top 12 results show of season 3 to the end of season 17, a rule regarding voting was enacted with regard to iTunes singles purchases. In the first two seasons, voting via iTunes purchases of contestant performances counted singly during the official voting window and only accredited to the live show in concern. When a competitor's performance peaked within the Top 10 of the iTunes "Top 200 Singles Chart" during this window, it was given an iTunes bonus that multiplies iTunes votes made by ten. In season 5, the iTunes bonus multiplier was reduced to five for the studio versions of the songs performed by the competitors. The finale's vote count included a 'Cumulative iTunes Vote Total' of all singles (from the live shows onwards) purchased during and outside of the various voting windows, with iTunes bonuses previously earned. Between seasons 15 and 17, the bonus multiplier was revised to include streams counting as a vote, and the only artist with the most streams after the voting window ended would receive the bonus. The iTunes bonus multiplier was discontinued beginning with the live shows of season 18, as the performances are now recorded away from the studios and could not be recorded to iTunes or Spotify; this measure was initially enacted for safety reasons as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. In season 19, studio performances are now recorded on YouTube Music, replacing the traditional iTunes and Spotify recordings that were done between the seasons 2–17, but this was changed back beginning season 20, though bonuses do not apply regardless if the song charted within the top 10 or not. Season 22 was the first season to not have any studio performances released on any platform overall.
Only the studio recording of the contestants' performances, not the live performance, were available on iTunes. In the first season, the battle rounds were recorded in the studio with both artists in the pairing. However, from season 2 to season 18, only the winner's version of the song from the battle round was released. Season 7 reverted to the old style of both artists. With the introduction of the Knockout Rounds in season three, where each contestant sang a separate song, only the winner's single was released.
The "Instant Save" was introduced in season five. During the live elimination episodes, viewers are given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants at risk of elimination by using their Twitter account (and since season 17, the official app) to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 13. Home viewers can only vote once per account for one contestant of their choice. Since season six, the instant saves now function as a last-chance performance where artists perform an additional song to rally votes.

In each season, the winner receives $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Republic Records (seasons 1 and 2) or later Universal Music Group (season 3–present).

Selection process and format
Each season begins with the "Blind Auditions", where coaches form their team of artists whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The number of artists varies per season, with a set range between 8 and 16 artists. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read "I want you." At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects their coach if more than one coach expresses interest. Introduced in the 14th season is "Block", which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant.
In the "Battle Rounds", each coach pairs two of their team members to perform together, then chooses one to advance in the competition. Each coach are assisted by different celebrity advisors varies each season. In season one, coaches sit alongside their respective advisors in the battle stage; however, the advisors no longer join the coaches in the battle stage starting season two. In season 23, there are no advisors and its coach assumed the duties for advising the artists alone. Season three introduced "steals", allowing each coach to save/select individuals who were eliminated during a battle round by another coach. First seen in the eighth season, artists are either given a walkover or is reassigned to a three-way battle in the event of another artist withdrawing from the competition if each coach sees fit. Saves were also added starting Season 14, which lets a coach prevent someone that they eliminated on their team from going home; in Season 23, Saves are replaced with "Playoff Pass" (based on the Battle Pass from the Australian version) which allow one artist to exempt them from participating in the Knockouts and directly advance to the Playoffs (the other artist advancing to the Knockouts as usual).
The Knockout Rounds were also introduced in season three (except for seasons six and sixteen). A pair of artists within a team are selected to sing individual performances in succession. They are not told until a few minutes prior to their performances who their partner is. The artists get to choose their own songs in this round, although they continue to get help and advice from their respective coaches, and since season six, a celebrity advisor serving as a mega mentor (except seasons 14 and 22). At the conclusion of the performances, coaches would decide which one of each pair gets to advance to the next round. Similar to the battle rounds, the coaches can steal one eliminated artist from another coach starting with season five. Starting in season 14, coaches can save one eliminated artist from their own team. From season 18 till 20, artists who were saved faced a Four-Way Knockout, with the winner decided through a public vote.The "Battles, Round 2" were introduced to replace the Knockout Rounds in season six. Similar to the Knockout Rounds, each singer is paired within their team. One celebrity key adviser also assists all four of the coaches and their teams in preparation of these rounds. Coaches give each Battle pairing a list of songs and each pair must agree on which song to sing. Like the first Battle round, each coach can still decide which of their singers in each pair will advance to the next round, and also allowed one steal.In the sixteenth season, the knockouts were replaced by The Live Cross Battles, a format identical to the Cross Battles from the Chinese version of The Voice. Each coach selects an artist to perform with another coach's artist together. The artist that receives the public vote will move on to the Playoffs, while the losing artist may be eliminated from the competition. The Live Cross Battles did not return in season seventeen due to poor reception.Previously eliminated artists can also advance to compete in the live shows; between seasons nine and thirteen (except season 11), each coach saved one artist (from either the Battle or Knockout rounds) to put through to the Live Playoffs. For seasons 15, 16 and 20, selected singers (prior to the Live elimination rounds) are put through to the "Comeback Stage" (which would be mentored by a fifth coach) and competed in a series of duels for a place in the live shows, with the winner earning a right to join a team of their choice. Season 21 added "Voice Comeback" where each coach picked one artist to compete in a Twitter poll, and only one artist with the most votes moves on.
In the final live performance phase of the competition (playoffs and elimination rounds), artists perform in weekly shows, where public voting narrows to a final group of artists and eventually declares a winner.Under the current format since season three in favor on a more competitive standard previously seen on other similar reality shows, any artists, regardless of each team, who earned the lowest number of votes were progressively eliminated each week until five artists remain (three until season 6, then four prior to season 17), hence introducing a possibility where at least one coach would not represent a single artist in the finale.

However, in deciding who moves on to the final four phase, the television audience and the coaches have equal say. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale, where the outcome is decided solely by public vote. Season 18-20 temporarily reverted this format allowing each coach to guarantee at least one artist advancing in the finale to accommodate the short number of live shows at three weeks, but these changes were reversed on Season 21 by reverting to the regular elimination format while retaining the top five finalists.

Home viewers can only vote once per account for one contestant of their choice. Since season six, the instant saves now function as a last-chance performance where artists perform an additional song to rally votes.
