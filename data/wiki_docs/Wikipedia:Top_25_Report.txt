Title: Wikipedia:Top_25_Report
Prepared with commentary by Igordebraga, TheJoebro64, CAWylie, Ltbdl, GeorgeBailey, and a helpful IP.
⭠ Last week's report
Many recent deaths here, including the top entry that only died at 100, and two who were almost centenarians as well (plus the still living widower of one). Otherwise there's also films and the return of emperors and (wrestling) kings.

Exclusions
This list excludes the Wikipedia main page, non-article pages (such as redlinks), and anomalous entries (such as DDoS attacks or likely automated views). Since mobile view data became available to the Report in October 2014, we exclude articles that have almost no mobile views (5–6% or less) or almost all mobile views (94–95% or more) because they are very likely to be automated views based on our experience and research of the issue. Please feel free to discuss any removal on the talk page if you wish.
