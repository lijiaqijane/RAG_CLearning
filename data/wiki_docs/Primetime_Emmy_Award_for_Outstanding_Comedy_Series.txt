Title: Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Comedy_Series
The Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series is an annual award given to the best television comedy series of the year. From 1960 to 1964, this category was combined with the Comedy Specials (one time programs) category so that both type of programs competed for the same award during those years. The award goes to the producers of the series.

The Flintstones and Family Guy are the only animated sitcoms to be nominated for the award. As of 2020, Fleabag (United Kingdom)  and Schitt's Creek (Canada) are the only shows from outside the United States to win this award.The Big Three networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) have dominated the category. Only six other networks have won the award: HBO (once with Sex and the City and three times with Veep) four times, Fox (with Ally McBeal and Arrested Development) and Apple TV+ (with Ted Lasso) twice, and Amazon Prime Video (with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), the BBC (with Fleabag; although seen later on Prime Video), and Pop TV (with Schitt's Creek; originally seen on CBC Television) once.
