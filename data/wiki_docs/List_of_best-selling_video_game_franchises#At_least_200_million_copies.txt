Title: List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises#At_least_200_million_copies
This is a list of video game franchises that have sold or shipped at least twenty million copies. Unless otherwise stated, numbers indicate worldwide units sold, ordered alphabetically whenever two or more list the same amount. The exception are the ones specifying shipments, which have lower precedence than others listing sales.
Franchise sales include expansion packs even though they are not considered full video games. Free-to-play game downloads (including free mobile games) and microtransactions should not figure into sales or shipment figures. For video game franchises that have generated the highest overall media revenue (from games and other media and merchandise), see the list of highest-grossing media franchises.
